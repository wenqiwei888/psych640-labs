## Different Data, Different Plots
- Today we're going to move away from scatter plots and lines graphs, and use the `ToothGrow` data set to look at:
    - Histograms
    - Boxplots
    - Barplots
- Along the way, we'll learn more graphical parameters that control the appearance of our figures
    - Focus on settings that change the global layout of the plots, rather than appearance of the data itself

## ToothGrow
- The `ToothGrow` data set measures the effects of Vitamin C on the length of Guinea Pig teeth. 
- 2 Factors: 
    1. Dose Level: .5, 1, or 2 mg.
    2. Delivery Method: O.J. or vitamin supplements

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)
```

## Histograms {.smaller}
- Histograms summarize a single continuous variable by showing the relative likelihoods of observing specific values. To give a representative summary, be sure to consider:
    1. The number of breaks on the x-axis (i.e., how wide are the bins)
    2. Use of frequency (i.e., total counts) or proportions on the y axis

<div class="columns-2">  
```{r tooth_hist, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4.5,echo=-1}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1))
hist(ToothGrowth$len,freq = TRUE,
     main = NULL, xlab="Tooth Length")
hist(ToothGrowth$len,freq = FALSE,
     main = NULL, xlab="Tooth Length")
```
</div>

## Histograms {.smaller}
- You can also change whether values that fall **exactly** on a break value are sorted into the left or the right hand bin. 
    - This is especially important for summarising discrete data with a small number of possible responses (e.g. a 7-point likert scale).

<div class="columns-2">  
```{r tooth_hist2, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4.5,echo=-1}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1))
hist(ToothGrowth$len,right = TRUE) # right-inclusive
hist(ToothGrowth$len,right = FALSE) # left-inclusive
```
</div>

## Histograms 
In the previous example, the bins were too wide and made the histogram looked rectangular. We can change this with the `breaks` argument:

```{r fake_breaks, echo = TRUE,eval=FALSE}
hist(ToothGrowth$len, breaks = 20, main =NULL,xlab = "Tooth Length")
```

We'll compare how well different breaks describe the data by plotting several on the same figure. We can do this by changing the `mfrow` (**m**ultiple **f**igures by **row**) graphics setting.

The `mfrow` is set through `par()`, and divides the plot window up into a grid regions so a different plot can be drawn in each region. 

## Â¡Danger!
When using `par`, remember that the changes you make affect *all subsequent plots*, which is not usually what you want. 

One solution is to make a copy of the default `par()` settings *before* you modify them, then use that copy to reset the defaults after your plotting.

```{r pardefaults,warning=FALSE}
par_defaults <- par(no.readonly=TRUE) # copy the current settings
## Do some plotting stuff 
par(par_defaults) # Reset the  defaults 
```

If you happen to forget this, another trick is to restart your R session (Ctrl + Shift + f10) or "Restart R" under the "Session" menu.

## par 
With the warnings finished, lets change the plot window layout.

- `mfrow` must be a vector of length 2.
    - The first element gives the desired number of rows in the grid layout
    - The second element gives the number of columns 

With `par()`, you modify the settings using keyname/value pairs. So, the syntax for setting the layout style with `mfrow` is:

```{r set_mfrow}
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # sets a 2x2 grid of plots
```

## Comparing Breaks {.helppage}
Now that we've set par, lets looks at 4 different values for the `breaks' arguments (the right two columns seem the best)

<br>
```{r diff_breaks,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
breaksList <- list(quote(8), quote(16),quote(32), substitute(seq(0,35,by=2.5)))
for (x in breaksList) { 
  hist(ToothGrowth$len, breaks = eval(x), main = paste("breaks =",deparse(x)),xlab = "Tooth Length")
}
```

## Common Axis {.smaller .img-centered}
When putting multiple plots on one figure, its often useful to have them share a common axis. You can suppress the plotting of the axis by setting the `xaxt` or `yaxt` to 'n', and then manually drawing an axis on the last figure you plot

```{r no_acis,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3, echo= c(2,3,5,6)}
par(mar=c(2,4,2,2))
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(ToothGrowth$len, breaks=20, main=NULL, xlab=NULL, xaxt="n")
par(mar=c(4,4,.5,2))
hist(ToothGrowth$len, breaks=60, main=NULL, xlab="Tooth Length", xaxt="n")
axis(side=1,col="blue", lwd=2) # side 1 is bottom axis
```

The `axis()` function, allows for very fine grained control over axis appearance

## Box Plots {.img-centered}
Box plots are a good way to present the shape of an observed sample along with some summary statistics. 

Unlike histograms, we can plot an arbitrary number of box plots on the same axis without invoking `par()`
```{r boxplotting,fig.height=2.75,echo=-1}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1))
OJ <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp=="OJ"]
AA <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp=="VC"]
boxplot(OJ, AA, names=c("Orange Juice","Ascorbic Acid"),
        xlab="Supp. Type", ylab="Tooth Length")
```

## Box Plots {.img-centered}
If our data  come from a data frame, we can use a formula instead of subsetting out every individual group.

Below, the formula `len~dose`  means "Group the values in the `len` column by the values in the `dose` column. `dose` has 3 unique values, so we get 1 boxplot per dose.

```{r boxplot_formula,fig.height=3,echo=-1}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1))
boxplot(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth,xlab="Dose", ylab="Tooth Length")
```

## Customizing Box Plots {.img-centered}
Two useful boxplot customizations are:

1. Make them horizontal (`horizontal = TRUE`)
2. Make their width proportional to the sample size (`varwidth=TRUE`)
```{r boxplot_formula2,fig.height=3,echo=-1}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1))
boxplot(len~dose, data=ToothGrowth, horizontal = TRUE,
        varwidth=TRUE,ylab="Dose",xlab = "Tooth Length")
```

## Bar Plot {.img-centered}
Bar plots are used to visualize single summary statistics, like the mean and median across groups. Here is the basic syntax for `barplot` for plotting a vector. 

```{r simple_barplot,fig.height=3.5}
barplot(height = c(5,10,7.5), names.arg = c("Slow","Medium","Fast"),
        main="Fictional Data",ylab="Avg. Score",xlab="Speed")
```


## Bar Plot
Since bar plots only plot 1 value per group, we need to summarise the `ToothGrowth` data before plotting.

```{r summarise_teeth,echo=1:3,warning=F,message=F}
# Don't worry about this just do it =)
library(dplyr); library(reshape2)
TG <- ToothGrowth %>% group_by(supp,dose) %>% 
  summarise(y = mean(len)) %>% acast(supp~dose) %>%
  `dimnames<-`(list("Supp"=c("O.J.","Vit. C"), "Dose"=c(.5,1,2)))
knitr::kable(as.table(TG), caption = "Mean Tooth Length by Supplement and Dosage")
```

Reshaping from `data.frame` to `matrix` is neccesary because `barplot` can only work with vectors or matices.

## Bar Plot {.img-centered}
The default `barplot` settings for a matrix are not so hot.
```{r bar, fig.height = 3}
barplot(TG,xlab="Dose", ylab="Tooth Length")
```
Side-by-side barplots are preffered to stacked barplots, and we need a legend, to have a functional plot. 

## Barplot: Good {.img-centered}
Use `beside=TRUE` to put the bars next to one another.
```{r barplot_good, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5,echo=-1}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))
barplot(TG, beside = TRUE, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length")
```

## Barplot: Better{.img-centered}
Lets increase the size of the main title, the two axis tick labels (`cex.names` = y axis tick labels, `cex.names` = x axis tick labels), and the axis labels themselves 
```{r barplot_better, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5,echo=-1}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))
barplot(TG, beside = TRUE, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length", 
        cex.main=1.75, cex.axis=1.35,
        cex.names=1.35, cex.lab=1.25)
```

## Barplot: Best {.img-centered}
```{r barplot_best, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5,echo=-1}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))
barplot(TG, beside = TRUE, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length", 
        legend.text=TRUE, args.legend=list(x=3,y=25,bty="n"),
        cex.main=1.75, cex.axis=1.35,
        cex.names=1.35, cex.lab=1.25)
```

You can also use the `legend` function we looked at last time.

## Legend Placement
In a barplot, its hard to know what x and y coordinates to use for your legend if the position keywords are not appropriate for your plot (e.g. the "topright" corner has data in it). 

One trick is to use the `locator()` function. 

1. Call `locator()` with no arugments, and your cursor should turn into crosshairs.
2. Click those cross hairs on the plot window and  hit `escape`
3. In the console, you should see the x and y position of the point you clicked on. 
4. Yay!

## Asepct Ratio {.smaller}
- We can force the length of the x and y axis to be equal on our plots
    - `par(pty="s")` makes the plot region square, no matter the window size
    - `par(pty="m")` makes the plot region as large as margins allow

A square plot is very useful when the both axis have the same limits (e.g., when both x and y axis go from 0 to 1)

<div class="columns-2">  
```{r barplot_aspect, fig.height = 2.75,fig.width = 5,echo=-1}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1))
par(pty="m")
barplot(TG, beside = TRUE, 
        xlab="Dosage (mg)",
        ylab="Tooth Length", 
        legend.text=TRUE, 
        args.legend=list(x=3,y=25,
                         bty="n"))
par(pty="s")
barplot(TG, beside = TRUE,
        xlab="Dosage (mg)",
        ylab="Tooth Length",
        legend.text=TRUE,
        args.legend=list(x=16,y=25,
                         bty="n"))
```

## Barplots
One thing is missing from our barplots that was included in our other 2 types of figures: An estimate of variability!

We'll add errors bars equal to 1 Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) to our barplot, using the matrix made below

```{r TGerror,echo=1}
TGerr <- ToothGrowth %>% group_by(supp,dose) %>% 
  summarise(sd = sd(len)/sqrt(n())) %>%
  acast(supp~dose,value.var="sd")
knitr::kable(as.table(TGerr), caption = "Standard Error of the Mean for Tooth Length by Supplement and Dosage")
```

## Error Bars
The key is to plotting error bars capturing the return value of barplot, which tells you the x-axis coordinates the bars are centered on. 
```{r errorbars_step1, fig.height = 4,fig.width = 5}
x <- barplot(TG, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length",
             legend.text=TRUE, beside=TRUE, ylim=c(0,35),
             plot=FALSE, args.legend =list(x=3,y=30,bty="n"))
print(x)
```
Then, you can use this matrix to tell the `arrows` function where to plot the error bars along the x axis.

## Error Bars {.img-centered}
`arrows()` needs the starting x and y coordinates of the error bars (arguments `x0` and `y0`) and the ending x and y coordinates (arguments `x1` and `y1`). 

The `angle` argument should be 90 (i.e. a line cap), and the `code` should be 3 (meaning draw caps on top and bottom).
```{r errorbars_step2, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5,echo=3}
par(mar=c(5,4,0,0))
x <- barplot(TG, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length",
             legend.text=TRUE, beside = TRUE,ylim=c(0,35),
             args.legend =list(x=3,y=30,bty="n"))
arrows(x0=x, y0=TG+TGerr, x1=x, y1=TG-TGerr, angle=90, code=3,
       length=.1)
```

## More layout control
Lets imagine we want to put our histogram, box plot and barplot on the same figure.

We could use `mfrow` or `mfcol` to do that, but we have an odd number of plots, and would end up with a blank spot in the grid of plot locations. 

A better choice would be to use the `layout` function, which lets you divide the plot window into rows and columns for multiple plots, but **also** lets you specify how many rows and columns each plot takes up.

## More layout control
- The primary argument to `layout` is a `mat`, a numeric matrix
- The dimensions (e.g. 2 by 2) determine the number of rows and column in the plot window
- The value in each cell of the matrix determine which rows and columns the next figure is drawn across

For example, passing the matrix $\left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1 \\ 2 & 3\end{array}\right]$ to `layout` means:

1. Create a 2x2 grid layout
2. Draw the first plot made across both columns of the first row
3. Draw the second and third plots in one column each of the second row


## More layout control {.smaller .img-centered}
Lets use this layout matrix to put our 3 plots in the same figure window.
```{r layouttime,fig.height=3.25,fig.width = 8, fig.show="hold",echo=-1}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
layout(mat=matrix(c(1,1,2,3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE))
boxplot(len~dose, data=ToothGrowth, horizontal = TRUE, varwidth=TRUE, 
        xlab="Tooth Length", ylab="Dose")
hist(ToothGrowth$len,freq = FALSE, main = NULL, xlab="Tooth Length")
x <- barplot(TG, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length", legend.text=TRUE,
             beside = TRUE,ylim=c(0,35), args.legend =list(x=3,y=40,bty="n"))
arrows(x0=x, y0=TG+TGerr, x1=x, y1=TG-TGerr, angle=90, code=3, length=.1)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # reset back to default layout
```

## More layout control
You might notice that there is still some "dead space" in this layout (i.e. space where it is not useful) and a lack of space where we might want some to be.

To fix this, we often want to change the:

- inner margin size (the distance between the plot axis and the figure limits)
- the outer margin size (the padding between the figure limits and the window edges)

## mar and oma {.img-centered}
- The graphical parameter `mar` controls the inner margins, shown as the distance between the green and blue boxes below
- The  graphical parameter `oma` controls the outer margins, shown as the distance between the blue and red boxes below (default distance is 0)

![](/images/margins.png)<br>

## mar and oma {.helppage}
You change these distances with the `par` function, passing in a 4-element vector. The 4 elements of the vector correspond to the distances along the bottom, left, top, and right sides, respectively.
```{r adjustmargins,echo=1:2, fig.height=3.25, fig.width = 8, fig.show="hold"}
par(mar = c(4,4,2,2)) # Shrink vertical margins of each plot
par(oma = c(1,1,1,1)) # Add 1 line of padding around the window
layout(mat=matrix(c(1,1,2,3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE))
boxplot(len~dose, data=ToothGrowth, horizontal = TRUE, varwidth=TRUE, 
        xlab="Tooth Length", ylab="Dose")
hist(ToothGrowth$len,freq = FALSE, main = NULL, xlab="Tooth Length")
x <- barplot(TG, xlab="Dosage (mg)", ylab="Tooth Length", legend.text=TRUE,
             beside = TRUE,ylim=c(0,35), args.legend =list(x=3,y=50,bty="n"))
arrows(x0=x, y0=TG+TGerr, x1=x, y1=TG-TGerr, angle=90, code=3, length=.1)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # reset back to default layout
```

## Activity
Using the `warpbreaks` data set:

1. Make a box plot for each combination of wool type (A and B) and tensions (Low, Medium, and High), all on the same axis.
2.  Make a bar plot for each combination of wool type and tensions with errors bars (summary code below), be sure to include a legend.
3. Put these two figures in one plot window, with `layout` or `par(mfrow)`.

```{r activity}
library(dplyr); library(reshape2)
WB <- warpbreaks %>% 
  group_by(wool,tension) %>% 
  summarise(y = mean(breaks),
            se = sd(breaks)/sqrt(n()))
WB_means <- acast(WB, wool~tension,value.var="y")
WB_err <- acast(WB, wool~tension,value.var="se")
```

```{r activity_sol,include =FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
boxplot(breaks~wool*tension, data=warpbreaks, horizontal=TRUE,
        xlab="Number of Breaks",ylab = "Yarn Type (A,B) by Tension (L, M, H)",
        main = "Yarn Breakages Across Types")
x <- barplot(WB_means,beside = TRUE, main = "Yarn Breakages Across Types",
             xlab = "Tension", ylab = "Avg. Breaks", ylim = c(0,55),
             legend.text=TRUE, args.legend=list(x=9, y=45, bty="n"))
arrows(x0=x, y0=WB_means-WB_err, x1=x, y1=WB_means+WB_err, code=3,angle=90,
       length=.1)
```
