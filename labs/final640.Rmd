## Lab Final
Download the <a href="../data/640finaldataset.txt" download> 640finaldataset.txt </a> file. It is an underscore-delimited file which contains simulated data from 11 independent groups of participants (labeled "A" through "K") with 100 participants in each group. Write a script that does the following:

1. Remove the data from group C
2. Print the grand mean of all observations
3. Perform a series of two-tailed t-tests that compares the mean of each group to the mean of group A. You may use the `t.test` function, but it may only appear 1 time in your program
