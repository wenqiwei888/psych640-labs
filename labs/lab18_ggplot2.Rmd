## The Grammar of Graphics
We're going to continue the tour of the `ggplot2` package we began [last week](./lab17_ggplot2.html)

We'll look at data management issues in the context of ggplot-ing, explore some more "advanced" features of the package, and make some common types of visualizations.

## The `iris` dataset {.img-centered}
We'll begin our examples with the `iris` dataset, which gives measurements of the length and width (in cm.) of the sepals and petals from 3 species of irises (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*).
![sepal and petal](/images/sepal.png)

## The `iris` dataset
Lets take a glimpse at the data itself.
```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
pander(prettifyTable(iris,6), split.tables = Inf)
```

## The `iris` dataset
Let's warm up by making a scatter plot of Sepal width against the Sepal length for the 3
different species. We'll save the plot as an object, so we can build on it in later slides.

```{r iris_scatter, fig.height=2.75}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = iris, 
        mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
print(p)
```

## Adding smooths
ggplot has a special geometric object called a "smooth", which is a line path whose x and y values are determined by a regression algorithm (e.g., loess, or lm).

We can show a regression line and conditional mean C.I. for each flower group by adding a `geom_smooth` layer to the plot, and setting the `method` argument to be `"lm"`.

```{r iris_smooth, fig.height=2.75}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)
```

## Layer-specific data and mappings
So far, any geometric object layers we've added have inherited their data and aesthetic mapping from the "global" mapping defined in the call to the `gpplot` function.

However, that need not be the case: geoms can set their own layer-specific data sets and aesthetic mappings. This feature is mainly useful for two tasks:

  - Adding summary-level information to plots of raw data
  - Plotting part of a dataset with one geom, and different part with another geom (e.g. mixing a barplot and a scatter plot.)


## Layer-specific mappings
The layer-specific dataset or mapping  is set inside the call the `geom_*whatever*`, using the same syntax as inside `ggplot`.

Here, we'll use a layer specific mapping for `geom_smooth` which removes the mappings of `Species` to color, thus regressing width on length for all 3 species of iris at once.

```{r bad_idea, fig.height=2.75}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE,
                mapping = aes(color = NULL))
```

## Layer-specific mappings
Of course, this is an example of how to use `ggplot` and not an example of how to fit a regression model. 

Ignoring species is a Bad Ideaâ„¢, because our model violates the assumption of normally distributed residual error around the regression line.

```{r, ref.label="bad_idea", echo=FALSE}

```

## Layer-specific data
A better use of layer-specific setting would be to add another layer of points that has the mean Sepal width and length for each species.

To do this, we'll need to create a dataset that summaries the Sepal length and width for each species with their average size.

```{r sepal_summary, echo = 1:2}
library(dplyr)
iris_means <- iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise_each("mean")
pander(iris_means, split.table = Inf)
```

## Layer-specific data
Now, we'll include another layer of points, and set it to use the summarized dataset as its source of information. We'll also set it to use a different shape (an X) and size, so we can distinguish it from the raw data.

```{r means}
p + geom_point(data = iris_means, size = 5, shape = 4)
```

## Adding Petal Width and Length
So far we've only been looking at half the data, so lets add in the Petal length and width data. 

But we've got a problem: the widths and lengths for Petals and Sepals are separated individual variables!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pander(prettifyTable(iris,2), split.tables = Inf)
```

This means we can't easily add a new aesthetic mapping to distinguish Sepal measurements from Petal measurements, because there is no single variable in the data set which identifies Sepal measurements from Petal measurements.

## The `iris` dataset
We'll need to reshape the data, so that one variable in the data set identifies Sepal measurements from Petal measurements in the `Length` and `Width` variables.

```{r iris_reshape}
library(tidyr)

# Add a primary key
iris_normal <- mutate(iris, FlowerID = row_number(Species)) %>%
# change layout to long-form
  gather(key = variable, value = size, Sepal.Length:Petal.Width) %>%
# Break "Sepal/Petal" & "Length/Width" into 2 columns
  separate(variable, c("Structure", "dimension"))

# Make a variable for length and width each  
iris_long <- spread(iris_normal, dimension, size)

  
```

## The new `iris_long` dataset
Ah, much better

```{r iris_normal, echo=FALSE}
pander(prettifyTable(iris_normal, 7), split.table = Inf)
```

## Plotting Petal and Sepal measurements
Since the plot of just the Sepal measurements was already pretty "full", I think the best way to add in the Petal measurements is to put the Sepal measurements and the Petal measurements into two different panels.

Panel's are called `facets` in the "grammar of graphics", and are functionally similar to dividing the plot window up into a "matrix" of different plots in base R plotting with `par(mfrow = c(x,y))`.

Facets are added to the plot with the `facet_grid()` function (for when the number of facets could evenly fill a matrix) or the `facet_wrap()` function (for the more general case when the number of facets does *not* evenly fill a matrix)

## Facetting
Facets are added just like adding a new geom layer, and the layout of the panels is determined using the `lm`-style formula syntax. 

Here, we're asking for that dataset to be divided into different plots according to the values of the `Structure` variable. 

We'll use `facet_grid` here, since dividing plot according to the `Structure` variable would evenly fill a 2x1 or 1x2 matrix. 

```{r facetting, eval = 1, echo= 1}
p <- ggplot(data = iris_long, 
        mapping = aes(x = Length, y = Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid( ~ Structure)
print(p)
```

We'll show the plot on the next slide...

## Facetting
Panels created with faceting share the same scales!.
```{r, ref.label="facetting", echo= 1}
```

## Plots with error bars
Lets switch from scatter-plotting the lengths and widths to plotting some summary statistics of the Petal/Sepal lengths and widths for each species.

Of course, any good plot of summary statistics includes error bars. Luckily, ggplot makes it easy to add error bars, so long as we make their upper and lower limits part of the dataset we are plotting.

Step 1: Summarizing the data, including the upper and lower bounds of the 95% CI.

```{r summarising}
iris_means <- iris_normal %>%
  group_by(Species, Structure, dimension) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(size), SD = sd(size), N = n()) %>%
  mutate(SEM = SD/sqrt(N),
         upper = avg + SEM*qt(.975, N-1,lower.tail = F),
         lower = avg - SEM*qt(.975, N-1,lower.tail = F))
```

## Petal/Sepal Averages
```{r averages, echo = FALSE}
pander(iris_means, split.table = Inf)
```

## Plotting the averages
This time, let's put the type of structure measured on the x-axis (i.e., map the `dimension` variable to the `x` aesthetic).


```{r plot_averages}
p <- ggplot(iris_means, aes(x = dimension, y = avg, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + facet_grid(~Structure)
print(p)
```

## Adding the confidence intervals
To add error bars for the confidence intervals, all we need to do is add a new layer containing them with `geom_errorbar`.

The 2 important aesthetics for the error bar geoms are `ymin` and `ymax`, which should be mapped to the `lower` and `upper` variables, respectively.

```{r error_bars}
p + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = .15)
```

## A barplot of the averages
You could also plot these averages with a barplot, which are created with `geom_bar`. Making a bar plot with these geoms requires a little tweaking:

  - The `color` aesthetic of bars corresponds to the color if the bar's perimeter, rather than the color of its area, so we need to map the `fill` aesthetic instead
  - To get side-by-side bars (instead of stacked bars), we need tell `ggplot` to put space between each bar with the `position_dodge()` function. This function takes 1 argument (`width`), which controls how far apart the bars are placed
  - By default, the y-axis aesthetic is determined by the total number of observations in each group. To map the y aesthetic to a value in our dataset, we need to set the `stat` argument to `"identity"`


## A barplot of the averages
Here's how we apply those tweaks to get a bar plot of the averages
```{r}
p <- ggplot(iris_means, aes(x = dimension, y = avg, fill = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 1)) + 
  facet_grid(~Structure)
print(p)
```

## A barplot with errror bars
To include error bars, we use `geom_errorbar` like before, but we also must set `position_dodge(width = 1)` to get each error bar to match up correctly.
```{r}
p + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
                position = position_dodge(width = 1),
                width = .15)
```

## Miscellaneous
There is still a lot more to ggplot (the author of the package has a [great book](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403)) but here are a few more pointers.

- You'll often need to change the name and limits of a scale. You can do this by invoking the appropriate `scale_*whatever*` function, and using the `scale_name` and `limits` arguments
    - E.g., `scale_y_continuous(scale_name = "Petal Width", limits = c(0,15))`
- Things like font, font size, background color, aspect ratio, etc., are controlled using the `theme` function.
    - The `theme` function is quite extensive, so see [this list](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/theme.html) and `?theme` for a description of all its arguments and options.
    - `ggplot2` includes several pre-made themes (e.g., use  `p + theme_bw()` for black and white, or `p + theme_dark()`)

## Activity
The `esoph` dataset reports the number of patients who did and did not develop esophageal cancer given three observational variables: age, alcohol consumption, and tobacco consumption (see `?esoph` for more info).

First, create 3 new variables using the code below.

  - `p`: The probability of getting cancer
  - `upper`: The upper bound of cancers (assuming a binomial distribution) 
  - `lower`: The lower bound of cancers (assuming a binomial distribution)

```{r}
esoph <- mutate(esoph, cell_size = ncontrols + ncases,
            p = ncases/cell_size,
            upper = qbinom(.975, size = cell_size, prob = p)/cell_size,
         lower = qbinom(.025, size = cell_size, prob = p)/cell_size,
         cell_size = NULL)
```

## Activity
Plot the probability of cancer for each group, along with errors bars, using

  1. A barplot
  2. A dot-plot

Remember to take advantage of facets, including `facet_grid` or `facet_wrap`.

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggplot(esoph, aes(x = agegp, y = p)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 1.5), stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(alcgp ~ tobgp) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
                position = position_dodge(width = 1.5), width =.15)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
points <- data.frame(age = 1:1600)
preds <- as.data.frame(Orange) %>% 
  group_by(Tree) %>% 
  do(model = lm(circumference ~ age, data = .)) %>%
  mutate(model = list(predict(model, points)),
         age = list(points$age)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest() %>%
  rename(circumference = model)

ggplot(data = Orange,  mapping = aes(x = age, y = circumference, color = Tree)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(data = preds) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", limits = as.character(1:5))
```
